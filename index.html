<h1>Tianna's Website</h1>
<p>I'm a sophomore, student athlete at james campbell highschool I have been wrestling for 2 years now, i started towards the ending of 
  eigth grade and I've enjoyed it ever since. I have 5 siblings, one brother and four sisters, I have a twin sister named Kianna who also wrestles
  with me. I have lived on Oahu my whole life, only leaving the island once, but in the future i plan to travel and see new places, the two
  pleaces I really want to go is Paris, Guam, and Germany. Guam is where my dad is from and where the Chamorro culture is, My dad talks about
  Germany also and says how beautiful is was when he was stationed there for the military a while back, and I really want to see Paris 
  because i see many beautiful images on social media and I just want to see it for myself</p>
