## Welcome to my website
This is going to by my personal website all about my life. My family, friends, hobbies, sports, etc.

### Welcome
My name is Tianna Chargualaf, I'am a sophomore at James Campbell highschool and I'am 14 years old. 

### About me 
as i said before my name is Tianna Chargualaf my full name is Tianna Kamia Chargualaf, my family calls me Kamia and my friends just call me Tianna. I've lived here in Hawaii my whole life, I've never been anywhere else. I have a family of 8 including myself. I'm a sophomore at James Campbell Highschool. Lastly, I have bad allergies to so many things. I'm allergic to pet dander so that means I'm allergic to my own dog :/ I'm allergic to dust, heat, cold, etc. that's because I was three months premature so my skin wasn't fully developed I guess, and at birth, I was only two pounds. so yeah, that's a bit about myself.

 **hobbies**
 My hobbies include drawing, watching some of my favorite tv shows or movies, talking and hanging out with my friends, working out with my dad, sleeping, and of course hanging out with my family.
 
 **sports**
 My whole family has not played a sport and wasn't good at it. My mom did gymnastics, my dad did football and wrestling, my two older sisters actually got a scholarship at Ottawa University for soccer, me, Kianna, and Bethany all do wrestling, and my younger brother plays football. before wrestling though we also did soccer for about three years but we didn't like it so our dad took us out and put us in karate. then he took us out of that and it was my dad's idea to join wrestling, I really didn't want to go because I thought you had to be really athletic and tough for that sport but eventually, I ended up going anyways because my dad said. I did it for a while and got really good at it, I got bumped up to varsity my freshman year, and I was doing it towards the end of eighth grade.
