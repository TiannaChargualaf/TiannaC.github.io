## Welcome to my website
This is going to by my personal website all about my life. My family, friends, hobbies, sports, etc.

### About me 
As i said before my name is Tianna Chargualaf my full name is Tianna Kamia Chargualaf. (fun fact: My middle name "Kamia is Chamorro for flower) my family calls me Kamia and my friends just call me Tianna. I've lived here in Hawaii my whole life, I've never been anywhere else. I have an identical twin sister, her name is Kianna. I'm a sophomore at James Campbell Highschool. Im allergic to many things such as my own dog ðŸ™ƒ and many more things. Lastly my favorite movie genres include, action, drama, romance, comedy, and adventure, basically all of them. 
 
**hobbies** 

 My hobbies include drawing, watching some of my favorite tv shows or movies, hanging out with my friends, working out with my dad, sleeping, and of course hanging out with my family. My favorite things to draw are Grafitti cartoon characters, anything cartoon really. Me and my family often go to the movies whenever we can, and we also like to go to buffalo wild wings, only because my two older sisters work there and they give us free food. 

**sports**
 
 My whole family has not played a sport and wasn't good at it. My mom did gymnastics, my dad did football and wrestling, my two older sisters actually got a scholarship at Ottawa University for soccer, me, Kianna, and Bethany all do wrestling, and my younger brother plays football. before wrestling though we also did soccer for about three years but we didn't like it so our dad took us out and put us in karate. then he took us out of that and it was my dad's idea to join wrestling, I really didn't want to go because I thought you had to be really athletic and tough for that sport but eventually, I ended up going anyways because my dad said. I did it for a while and got really good at it, I got bumped up to varsity my freshman year, and I was doing it towards the end of eighth grade.
 
**family**

 I live with my 5 siblings, Ashlynn, Jaelynn, Kianna, Bethany, Chantz, and you can't forget about my dog, Bear. we've lived in Hawaii our whole lives. My dad comes from Guam and my mom comes from Canada. me, Kianna, Bethany, and Chantz (the younger siblings) alternate between my two parents because they're divorced, they've been divorced for over 5 years now, my two older sisters stay with my dad and just visit my mom because they've had some drama in the past.
